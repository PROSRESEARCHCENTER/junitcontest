AID - Abstract Interface Definition - A Tool to generate language specific
interfaces and classes (Java, C++, ...)&nbsp; from abstract interface definition
source files (.aid).
<P>
The tools reads in one or more .aid files, parses them for correctness and
keeps all information in a runtime-type-identification (RTTI) tree in
memory. It then uses several generators to generate the language specific interfaces and/or classes.
It also uses a simple pre-processor to handle cases where the method definitions
differ between different languages.
<h2>
AID Syntax</h2>
<P>
Multiple interface definitions may be put in one aid file. However interfaces/classes are output as
one file per interface/class.<P>
Comments of type (/**...*/, /*...*/ or //...) may exist in any place, however only the following comments are copied to
the generated files:
<UL>
<LI>Comments in front of the <B>package</B> statement.
<LI>Comments in front of the <B>interface</B> statement.
<LI>Comments in front of fields (values and <b>enum</b> definitions).
<LI>Comments in front of methods.
<LI>Comments in front of the closing bracket of the interface.
<LI>Comments at the end of the file.
</UL>
It should be noted that comments inserted between parameters, variables and values of
<b>enum </b>definitions are <b> NOT</b> copied.
<P>
The syntax of the AID language is similar to the java language for its
definition part, using the following constructs:
<ul>
  <li><b>package</b></li>
  <li><b>interface</b></li>
  <li><b>class</b>, implementing interfaces, and having static methods defined in @java {} closures</li>
  <li>methodheaders</li>
  <li>constant values</li>
</ul>
<P>
and adds the following keywords and symbols:
<UL>
<LI><B>const</B> to define the constness of parameters, return types as well
as functions, as needed by C++.
<LI><B>&</B> for references in C++, for example ITuple &amp;.
<LI><B>*</B> for pointers in C++, for example ITuple*[].
<LI><B>enum</B> for C++ constants.
<LI><b>=</b> for default values in method definitions.
<LI><B>&lt;</B and <B>&gt; to handle reference (but not definition) of
  parameterized types such as Collection&lt;String&gt;.
</UL>
<P>If methods differ too much to be uniquely defined for different languages,
then one can use the pre-processor included in aid. It allows the user to define
different sections for different target languages. The following statements are
allowed:
<ul>
  <li><b>@ifdef </b><i>property</i></li>
  <li><b>@ifndef</b> <i>property</i></li>
  <li><b>@else</b></li>
  <li><b>@endif</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The properties defined depend on the selected generator, see below. The
section that runs through the preprocessor without being filtered, is properly
parsed by aid, so should adhere to the aid language. Imports/includes and types
will be properly generated.</p>
<P>
A language specific closure may exist using the syntax
<TT>"@cpp { non-parsed language specific text}"</TT> at any place where comments may exist and
are copied. The closure will be copied for that language only. Any language acronym can be
defined and picked up the generator, as long as it is an identifier starting with "@".
The sections between the curly braces are NOT parsed by aid, has to conform the
target language and any typing/imports/includes (see below) will not be
generated.
<P>
The tool could easily be extended for other language bindings if necessary.
<P>
The parser for AID is generated by JavaCC (JavaCompilerCompiler) from a .jj file
which describes the AID language in tokens and productions of these tokens.
<h2>AID Generators</h2>
<p>
The generators use a set of tables to do translations of <b>types</b>, lookup
which <b>include</b>/<b>imports</b> are needed and define initial <b>values</b>.
These tables can be extended by the user.</p>
<p>
Aid translates types (return types, types of parameters, types
of inheritance, types of exceptions and types of variables) to
language specific types.
Primitive types are not looked up. To inherit a class in one language and not in another one simply defines
a special type, setting it in one property table to the superclass and in
the other to nothing.</p>
<p>Resulting language specific types are looked up in tables to see if they need
imports/includes or forward declarations.</p>
<p>Initializer values are also looked up in tables. If mapped to the empty
string, the initialization will be omitted. Care must be taken that initial
values are only specified starting at
the end of the parameter list, and if mapped to the empty string, no initial
values appear in front of that parameter, or all initial values in front have to map to
the empty string.</p>
<h3>JavaInterface / JavaClass Generator</h3>
<P>The property file <b>aid.types.java.properties</b> is used to lookup of java
types. Since the aid files are almost the same as java, most types will not need
translation and this table may be more or less empty.<P>The property file <b>aid.imports.java.properties</b>
is used lookup what imports are needed. <P>The property file <b>aid.values.java.properties</b>
is used to lookup initializer values. Most values will not need a translation.
However, since java does not have initializer values for methods, extra methods are generated
with shorter parameter lists for the interface. The JavaClass generator will
generate an Abstract class
which leaves the full method abstract, but fills in all the initial values for the
corresponding methods with shorter parameter lists.<P><b>Enum</b> definitions
are output as lists of, and <b>const</b> as public final static variables.&nbsp;<P><b>Const</b>
on methods and any modifier (<b>&amp;*@</b>) are not output to the java
language.<P>Parameterized types are output as extra comments on the top-level
type.<P>Both Java generators define the property <b>java</b>, while the
JavaInterface generator also defines <b>java.interface</b> and the JavaClass
generator defines<b> java.class</b>.<h3>CPPHeader Generator</h3>
<P>The property file <b>aid.types.cpp.properties </b>is used to lookup of C++
types. Most types will need a translation.<P>The property file <b>aid.includes.cpp.properties</b>
is used to lookup what include files are needed. Care must be taken if fully
qualified names (including ::) are used as keys, since colons need to be escaped
in keys in the property file (write \:\:). If a C++ type is defined as the empty
string no include statement is added to the file. This can be used for classes
which need no include. If the C++ type is not defined the type will be added as
a forward declaration.<P>The property file <b>aid.values.cpp.properties</b> is
used to lookup initializer values. Most values will need a translation.<P>Exceptions
are currently removed in the C++ header. However, if the return type of a method
is void, it is replaced by bool to allow the method to signal there was an
exception. The corresponding comment line describing the return value is also
replaced.<P>The package name is used as <b>namespace</b>, but is translated by
the type table. If defined as empty string, no namespace will be defined. Any
dots (.) in the namespace are translated to underscores (_).<P>The CPP Header
generator defines the properties <b>cpp</b> and <b>cpp.header</b>.
