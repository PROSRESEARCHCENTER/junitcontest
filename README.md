# Documentation

See [docs/README.md](docs/USERGUIDE.md) for the user guide and [docs/DEVELOPERS.md](docs/CONTRIBUTORGUIDE.md) for the contributor guide. 

More information about the infrastructure and how it can be used to set up an empirical evaluation for unit test generators can be found in [Devroey, X., Gambi, A., Galeotti, J. P., Just, R., Kifetew, F., Panichella, A., Panichella, S. (2021). JUGE: An Infrastructure for Benchmarking Java Unit Test Generators. Softw. Test.
